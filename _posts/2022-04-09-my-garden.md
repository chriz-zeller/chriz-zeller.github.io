<p>I'm inviting you into my garden.</p>
<p>Before judging me for my garden, learn about the circumstances.</p>
<p>Before changing my garden, understand the circumstances and ask for permission.</p>
<p>Ask for permission before leaving the marked paths.</p>
<p>If I'm asking you to leave, leave.</p>
<p>Remember, it is an invitation.</p>

<div style="text-align:center">
<p>What is the difference between judging me and judging my garden?</p>
<p>Do you really need to judge? Might it be enough to understand, respect, accept or tolerate?</p>
<p>Do you really need to change something? Are you able to stay for a while in an imperfect garden?</p>
