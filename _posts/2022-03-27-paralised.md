<p>Whatever I write, whatever I say, I always have voices of expected others
in my head saying 'Well, but have you considered ...'.</p>

<p>Therefore I get paralysed. Is there any way to make fail-safe statements?</p>

<p>Whatever I wrote, whatever I said, someone might pin me to it, blaming or
laughing at me or feeling disappointed because I changed my mind.</p>

<p>Therefore I get paralysed. Would it be better to always put a disclaimer on our
actions?</p>

<p>Whatever I write, whatever I say, I cannot foresee all its consequences. Some
I might would have wanted to pretend from happening.</p>

<p>Therefore I get paralysed. Is there any way to create only certain
consequences?</p>

<p>Whatever I write, whatever I say, might not be important or even wasting other
people's time.</p>

<p>Therefore I get paralysed. Is there any thing worth talking about?</p>

<p>But... not acting can also be harmful.</p>

<p>Are you treating the symptom or the cause by asking these questions?</p>
<p>Does it need to be fail-safe for achieving your goal?</p>
<p>How can you handle being unable to check the facts?</p>
<p>Is it a problem of our society to react negative on changes?</p>
<p>How do you know that your wanted consequences are the 'good' ones?</p>
<p>How can you know without communication whether it is worth talking?</p>
<p>How to act in an imperfect world?</p>
