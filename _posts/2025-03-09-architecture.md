# Why did you not search for another way to reach this page?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine a company that receives a lot of letters every day. Everyone that needs
to deposit letters gets a key to a box and a flyer with some information on how
to deposit letters.

Today, Robin comes, uses their key and deposits a letter with about 600 pages
in this box. Later this day, the company worker Kim opens the box and gets
grumpy because of this letter. Kim gets a lot of letters and is not able to
carry so many pages to their office. Additionally the whole box is blocked.

Kim is mad at Robin, because Robin should have known that a letter with such a
dimension should not have been deposit in this box. The flyer was clear on
that. There was another box, where Kris helped to distribute such special
letters.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is it not strange to be mad at the letter depositor instead of the company?
The company could made it hard to misuse the box:
- They could add prominent information on the box, to describe where to deposit
  letters with more than 30 pages or when thick paper was used.
- They could add a check list or position a person checking the letter. Then,
  informing based on the checking which box is appropriate.
- The company could use a letter slot instead of providing everyone with a key.
  Thereby, letters with more than 30 pages or with thick paper cannot be
  deposit in the wrong box. For people that still should have the possibility
  to deposit letters not fitting the slot, they could provide---only to
  them---a key to the box, telling them to use their power wisely.

If the company does not want to change the depositing of letters, then the
company could help Kim to deal with the letters in the box.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Companies often argue, that these changes are expensive, ignoring the
  consequences of not changing:
  - Kim is grumpy on Robin which gets in the way when Kim has to communicate
    with Robin.
  - Kim is grumpy and focuses on this bad situation instead of their work.
  - Kim is grumpy and might leaves the company due to such obstacles making
    their life harder than necessary.
  - The process of unblocking the box needs to be organised and thereby costs
    the company money.
  - A blocked box annoys everyone that has to use this box. Depositors might
    search for another company with better services.
- It is a strange idea to blame people for taking the straight forward and
  possible solution. If a door invites you to enter, would you search for an
  alternative entrance?
- Information about the proper behaviour needs to be strongly connected to the
  behaviour itself otherwise it is easily forgotten. Provide information and
  corrections while someone is acting, not only at some unrelated time (for
  example as oral introduction, flyer, email or memo).
- If people find obstacles between them and their goal, they are more likely to
  search for alternatives to reach their goal.
  - If you block a door, a person is more likely to search for an alternative
    entrance.
  - If a person is informed, while trying to enter, that they used the wrong
    door, the person is more likely to ask or search for an alternative
    entrance.
- While some people will not blame Robin in the above situation, it is not
  uncommon to blame a user of a computer programme for _using the programme
  wrong_. It is easy to blame the user, it is harder to create programmes that
  cannot be abused. However, do not easily accept excuses due to bad software
  architecture or processes implemented in software that do not properly
  address the needs. If you step up a staircase and thereby hit your head on
  the ceiling, you should blame the architect and builder more than yourself.
  The same holds for software, which was (hopefully) created and formed by
  software architects, programmers, and many more---software is not created by
  a higher mighty power; it is not fate. There are people that should be hold
  responsible for their decisions and work. Additionally, if flaws become
  known, software can and should be improved.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Everyone has their reasons to do things the way they do them. If you try to
understand them, you might be able to see the most effective spots for changes.
Besides, it might helps to accept that the world is imperfect instead of
getting grumpy.
